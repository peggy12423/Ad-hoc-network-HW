Predicting the effect of home Wi-Fi quality on QoE
## Summary
Whenever Wi-Fi quality being poor will degrades the Quality of Experience (QoE).
Detecting Wi-Fi quality degrades QoE before users call is extremely important for residential Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
In theis paper, their goal is to develop a system that runs on commodity access points (APs) to assist ISPs in detecting when Wi-Fi degrades QoE.
Thier contributions include developing a method to detect instances of poor QoE based on the passive observation of Wi-Fi quality metrics and applying their predictors of QoE given Wi-Fi quality to Wi-Fi metrics available on commodity APs with low errors collected customers of a large residential ISP. Our results show that QoE is good most of the time.ISPs can use the fraction of poor QoE samples to identify stations with frequent poor QoE due to Wi-Fi.
## Strength （優點）
1.They build a system for ISPs to detect when home Wi-Fi quality degrades QoE before QoE degrades.
2.To reduce the tests with real users, they measure application quality metrics and use state of the art methods to translate QoS into QoE as captured by the degradation of mean opinion scores(DMOS).
3.They vary the medium availability at the AP by introducing interference from Wi-Fi or non-Wi-Fi sources.
4.They use four applications to predict various Wi-Fi scenario.
5.They use a set of 20 different audio samples recommended by ITU-T for speech quality assessment to sumulatate real environment.
6.They map application QoS metrics into an estimated QoE, and denote the application QoS to QoE model as a function.
