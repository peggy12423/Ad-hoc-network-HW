Predicting the effect of home Wi-Fi quality on QoE
## Summary
Whenever Wi-Fi quality being poor will degrades the Quality of Experience (QoE).
Detecting Wi-Fi quality degrades QoE before users call is extremely important for residential Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
In theis paper, their goal is to develop a system that runs on commodity access points (APs) to assist ISPs in detecting when Wi-Fi degrades QoE.
Thier contributions include developing a method to detect instances of poor QoE based on the passive observation of Wi-Fi quality metrics and applying their predictors of QoE given Wi-Fi quality to Wi-Fi metrics available on commodity APs with low errors collected customers of a large residential ISP. Our results show that QoE is good most of the time.ISPs can use the fraction of poor QoE samples to identify stations with frequent poor QoE due to Wi-Fi.
