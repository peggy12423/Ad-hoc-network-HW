A Practical Self-Adaptive Rendezvous Protocol in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks

Summary
In cognitive radio ad-hoc networks, two users rendezvous on a common available channel to realize communications. However, the theoretical rendezvous successful rate may suffer from the available channel status changing, collisions on channels, congestion at users, and target users unavailability in practical scenarios.
The authors propose analytical models for each possible factor which affecting rendezvous rate.They also proposes the self-adaptive protocol which can adapt to the dynamic network.The protocal includes modules for channel state changing and data packet congestion.Furthermore, a collision avoidance mechanism and rendezvous delay compensation method are mentioned. Simulation results show that the method can enhance the rendezvous rate of the users in the channel, shorten the delay time of the rendezvous, and avoid the occurrence of congestion.
Strength （優點）
1.Most existing rendezvous papers focus on success-guaranteed channel-hopping(CH) sequence design. They ignore
